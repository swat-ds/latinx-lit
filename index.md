# THIS SITE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, PLEASE COME BACK AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER!

While the Latinx population in the United States is one of the largest groups in the country and the Latinx culture and people have a continually increasing presence and influence in all walks of life, their representation in the media is still extremely limited, poor, and marked by misconceptions, prejudices, and discriminatory remarks. Hence the urgent need for critical analysis of these representations that are pervasively producing narratives and imaginaries about and around the contested Latinx identity.

This digital exhibit brings together a series of analysis and research projects on the representation of Latinx in contemporary media, with a particular emphasis on digital platforms. Discussing a wide variety of topics and issues ranging from the representation of Latinx families and subjects in commercials or children shows to the controversial reception of the term Latinx itself, this exhibit is an attempt to better understand and critically analyze the narratives that are currently fashioning how Latinx are being portrayed and perceived. 

The project is the collaborative effort of students in the Fall 2017 First-Year Seminar “Introduction to Latinx Literature and Culture”, along with Assistant Professor Désirée Díaz and Research Librarian for Humanities & Interdisciplinary Studies Roberto Vargas at Swarthmore College.
